# `Mersenne Twister (MT)`
Although not the best contemporary algorithm (on performance, statistics and cryptography), this is one of the most influential PRNG, because of its advantages compared to its previous algorithms. It is used as default PRNG in many standard libraries e.g. Python, R, PHP, Lisp, GNU Octave, etc. 

There are some comtemporary faster (SFMT), statistically better (MTGP) and cryptographically secure (CryptMT) variants extending the impact of MT. Sadly, we stick to the basic version.
