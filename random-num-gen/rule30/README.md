# `Rule 30 / Elementary Cellular automaton`
Cellular automaton is a state machine where a state of a bit at *t + 1* is determined by state of neighbour bits at *t* based on some *rule set*. Complex, seemingly random patterns can be generated from pretty simple rule set (implying performant generators). Rule 30 is one such rule-set, and was default PRNG for Wolfram's Mathematica for some time.
